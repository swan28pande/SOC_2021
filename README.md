## DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR 2048 GAME

This project is being done as a part of <a href = 'https://github.com/wncc'>Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay</a>'s <a href="https://wncc-iitb.org/soc/">Seasons of Code 2021</a>.<br>
In this project, our end goal is to try to implement a **Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm** to play the game of 2048 and get the highest possible score. <br>

- Week 1 : Implemented **Expectimax Algorithm** to create an Agent to play the 2048 achiving a median score of 10K for tree depth of 3.
- Week 2 : Implemented **MDP Planning** to create an TicTacToe counteragent (given the moves of the oppponents at each state.
- Week 3 : Implemented **Tabular q-learning** to create a Snake Xenzia AI for an environement of size 4*4 achieving a median length of 12.2
- Week4 : Implemented **Deep q-leearning** to create an Agent to play the 2048 using a convNet with 4 conv layers & a fully connected layer achieving a median score of 37K & reaching the 2048 tile in more than 90% episodes
